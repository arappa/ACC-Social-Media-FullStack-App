# Social Media FullStack App

This coding project was used to get an overview of fullstack development and to gain a holistic understanding of how web applications work. Fullstack development encompasses 
both frontend and backend development. 

For this project I used the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The MERN stack is recognized as a simplified development platform for building 
highly scalable and interactive web applications.

React (Client side/Frontend) 
- React is a JavaScript library for building interactive and responsive user interfaces which is component based.
- Only communicates securely with the server
  
Express.js and Node.js (Server Layer)
- Express.js is a web application framework that runs on top of Node.js. It provides a higher-level API for building web servers and APIs
  - Middleman between DB and Client
- Node.js provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side
  
MongoDB (Database Layer)
- MongoDB is a highly scalable document database (NoSQL)
- Easy to store and retrieve data in JSON documents
- MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database Service
